# A simple Redux project

This repo is split into **2 branches**:
- The main branch uses the old **Redux** implementation
- The side branch uses the **Redux Tool Kit (RTK)** implementation

I did not make a live site for it, as it has hardly any features, only showcasing redux implementations by a simple counter app.

### The App uses:
- Vite
- React
- Redux
